# Sprite-Runners

Sprite Runners is a hyper-casual game built on Unity 3D Engine, using C# as the primary programming language. The game is an endless runner, in which the player controls a character who must run and jump over obstacles to keep going as far as possible.

## Gameplay

The gameplay is straightforward and intuitive. The player taps the spacebar to jump over obstacles while running at a constant speed. The longer the player runs, the more challenging the game becomes, as the obstacles become more frequent and harder to avoid.

The game uses various Unity components such as _Rigidbody, BoxCollider_, and _Animator_ to create realistic physics and animations for the character and obstacles. The game also uses Unity's UI system to create intuitive menus and interfaces for the player.
